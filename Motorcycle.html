    <h2><strong>Rules of game in motorcycle racing</strong></h2>
<p>MotoGP riders have three free practice sessions of 45 minutes, after which a first ranking is established. After a final free practice session of 30 minutes which does not take into account the lap times, the riders ranked above the tenth place of the combined ranking for first three practice sessions ride for fifteen minutes of qualification. The two best times are admitted to the race bringing together the top ten in the free standings for a new qualifying session, which will determine the first twelve places in the grid. Each line consists of three riders. To be qualified, a rider must have clocked a time at least equal to 107% of the time recorded by the fastest rider.

<h2><strong>Is it a team game in motorcycle racing</strong></h2>
<p>Track racing is a motorcycle sport where teams or individuals race opponents around an oval track. There are differing variants, with each variant racing on a different surface type.</p>
<h2><strong>When game was invented</strong></h2>
<p>
    In order to start their own Motorcycle Club, players will have to buy a Clubhouse from the Maze Bank Foreclosures website, which functions as a hub for all business and missions relating to your Club.
    <strong>
    Buying a Clubhouse
</strong>
    Clubhouses range in price from $200,000 to $495,000, but unlike some buildings in GTA Online where this price informs certain factors like the chance of being attacked by NPCs or various other negatives, here there doesn't appear to be any major distinction except for their ease of location in the world map. Clubhouses generally appear in three locations - Los Santos, the Southern coast of the Alamo Sea, and at the top of the map. Pick whichever one you think will be most convenient, or just which building you prefer.The Maze Bank Foreclosure site is the only way to buy yourself a biker clubhouse. | Joel Franey/USGamer, Rockstar North/Rockstar Games
    Renovating Your Clubhouse
    While buying your clubhouse, you can choose from several cosmetic or functional upgrades that alter the appearance of your clubhouse. You can also add these renovations later by going back into the Maze Bank Foreclosures site and reselecting the clubhouse you already own. The following renovations and what they entail are thus:
    	Mural (Free - $150,000): A cosmetic option that allows you to install various paintings on the inside walls of your clubhouse, varying from building to building. The default paintings are free, but the rest get more and more expensive. Taste and subtlety not included.
    	Style (Free - $400,000): Another cosmetic choice that allows you to change the interior of the building, usually towards looking more modern and contemporary. The default, free appearance looks kinda shabby, but maybe that's what you're into.
    	Club Emblem (Free - $62,000): Players can choose from one of ten coats of arms to place inside their clubhouse. If you have a Custom Crew Emblem, you can have that put in for free.
    	Club Name (Free - $50,000): This is where you get to pick the name of your MC Club, as well as the font and colour it's displayed in. Picking it while setting up your club is free, but be sure to pick one you're happy with - changing it afterwards costs $50,000.
    	Gun Locker ($320,000): An optional safe inside your Clubhouse that allows you to store guns you don't want or currently use. This means that when you're in a firefight, cycling through weapons for the one you want, you won't have to click through all the early firearms you've outgrown.
    	Custom Bike Shop ($530,000): An MC Club can store ten motorbikes inside it by default, but this upgrade allows you to modify and repaint them as you would in a Los Santos Customs shop in the open world. Keep in mind that altering bikes still costs money, so it's not going to be free custom work if you get the bike shop.
    Starting and Managing Your MC Club
    Once you have your clubhouse, it should be marked on your map by a simple representation of a house with a garage attached. You can go into it like any other building, by walking up to the blue circle by the door. Once inside, check out the laptop in the office (also marked on your mini-map) and use it to register as President of your Club. At this point, you'll be able to make managerial decisions from the Interaction Menu (hold down the Trackpad/View button on your controller), inviting other players to join and starting missions specific to MC Clubs that can allow you to make both money and reputation. You can even challenge other clubs to Deathmatches and Jousts.

<h2><strong>All detail of games in game</strong></h2>
<p>A game that needs little introduction, whilst it is not predominantly about motorbikes, it offers the variety of motorcycle heists, races and general riding – as well as the other (somewhat explicit) features and missions that every GTA guarantees.
    While missions and objectives involve all kinds of transport – the motorbike sections are greatly enjoyable. Racing can be difficult as it is a little too easy to crash, although as the game is not for those under 18 it is hard to imagine anything less. There is a great range of bikes in this game, which you have the opportunity to simply wander the streets and take any bike you wish (although this will normally come with the task of out-riding the police).
    GTA takes it to the next level with the Online Bikers update, which gives you the chance to purchase a wide variety of motorbikes which are different to those on your average motorcycle game. In time, you can find yourself creating a clubhouse and becoming president of a Motorcycle Club – which will see you having to protect your property from rivals and make money to fund your investments. You can pimp these beastly bikes to make them as intimidating as possible, as well as edit crew members appearance to ensure your Club are taken seriously and look the part.
    
    MotoE World Cup
    
    MotoE, officially the FIM Enel MotoE World Cup, is a class of motorcycle racing that uses only electric motorcycles. The series is sanctioned by the FIM and the inaugural season in 2019 was due to support MotoGP at five of the European circuits.[2] A fire in March 2019 involving recharging batteries destroyed the special facility and the race machines at Circuito de Jerez, Spain. The opening two race events, intended to be at Jerez on 5 May and Le Mans, France on 19 May, were cancelled,[3] with a new schedule announced in late March of six races at four venues starting in July.[4]
