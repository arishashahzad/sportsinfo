                Billiards
            </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>Cue sports, also known as billiard sports, are a wide variety of games of skill generally played with a cue stick, which is used to strike billiard balls and thereby cause them to move around a cloth-covered billiards table bounded by elastic bumpers known as cushions. Historically, the umbrella term was billiards. Wikipedia
            World Games: 2001 – present
            Equipment: Billiard balls, billiard table, cue sticks
            Venue: Billiard hall or home billiard room
            First played: 15th-century Europe, with roots in ground billiards
            Highest governing body: World Confederation of Billiards Sports
            Team members: Single opponents, doubles or teams</p>
            <h2><strong>How many players play the game?</strong></h2>
<p><h3>two players</h3> Billiards is a cue sport that is played by two players and utilises one object ball (red) and two cue balls (yellow and white). Each player uses a different color cue ball and attempts to score more points than their opponent and reach the previously agreed total required to win the match.</p>

    <strong>
        Strategy of the game?
    </strong>
</h2>
<p>The most important strategic decision made in 8-ball is choosing between “solids” and “stripes” after the break. Here are some good examples from Vol. III of the Video Encyclopedia of Pool Shots of things to consider
    Another important decision is in selecting “key” balls. Here are some examples from Vol. I of the Video Encyclopedia of Eight Ball (VEEB) and from Vol. III of the Video Encyclopedia of Pool Shots (VEPS):
    It is also very important to know how to deal with pocket blockers. Here are some examples from Vol. I of the Video Encyclopedia of Eight Ball (VEEB):
    
    t is also very important to know how to deal with common end-game situations. For examples, see the end-game situation strategy resource page.
    And here are some run-out examples from Vol. V of the Video Encyclopedia of Eight Ball (VEEB) and Vol. V of the Video Encyclopedia of Pool Shots (VEPS):
    
    Here are some useful drills from Vol. III of the Video Encyclopedia of Pool Practice (VEPP) to practice patterns common in 8-ball:
    
    Here’s a summary of important 8-ball strategy:
    1.	Choose “solids” or “stripes” wisely after the break (per the info above).
    2.	Choose the key ball for the 8 very carefully (per the info above).
    3.	Choose the key ball for the key ball very carefully.
    4.	Plan your run-out from the 8-ball backwards.
    5.	Reevaluate your run-out plan after each shot, especially if you get out of line.
    6.	Minimize CB motion when possible.
    7.	Walk around the table while evaluating a run-out plan.
    8.	Deal with problem balls as early as possible.
    9.	Clear balls from the center of the table early since they block common CB paths and can cause trouble late in the rack.
    10.	Break out clusters when there is an insurance ball available, and use as little speed as necessary for better control.
    11.	Don’t bump into or disturb balls (yours or your opponent’s) if it is not necessary.
    12.	Pocket or move balls that clear the way for other balls as early as possible.
    13.	Pocket balls in groupings to avoid having to go up and down the table.
    14.	If you can’t run-out, play a safety early in the game and solve problems (or create problems for your opponent, like a blocked pocket) in the process if possible.
    15.	On a “bar box,” avoid the side pockets when possible.
    16.	If you decide to run out, don’t miss, and don’t take the “easy shots” for granted.
    17.	Consider playing safe instead of attempting a low-percentage shot.
    18.	If your opponent has many more balls on the table than you, an offensive shot (even low percentage) is often better than a safety (unless the safety is extremely effective).
    19.	Try to avoid “one ball hell,” where you only have one OB left on the table and your opponent has many. It is very difficult to win in a situation like this.
    20.	When an opponent has you in a bad situation, with no reasonable offensive or defensive shot at one of your balls, consider an intentional foul where you pocket a problem opponent ball (assuming your opponent doesn’t have an easy run-out).
    Advice, strategy and options concerning the break are covered on the 8-ball break resource page.
    ________________________________________
    from Robert Byrne (in “Byrne’s New Standard Book of Pool and Billiards”):
    Byrne’s 13 Rules to Live by to Run the Table (in 8-ball or straight pool):
    1. Because a ball frozen on a rail can usually be approached from only one side and made easily in only one pocket, look for chances to make such shots early in the run.
    2. If you have a choice among several balls, take the one that clears the way for other balls.
    3. Beware of breaking a cluster toward an obstructed pocket.
    4. If it’s not too much trouble, wait until most loose balls around a cluster are gone before you break it; otherwise, you might create a new cluster.
    5. Think twice before breaking a cluster on a low percentage shot because if you miss and spread the cluster you have solved your opponent’s problem instead of your own. Think safety instead.
    6. Break small clusters lightly.
    7. Look for opportunities to break clusters when there is an insurance shot.
    8. Try not to bump into balls that are already separated to avoid forming new clusters.
    9. Don’t risk missing in order to get perfect position on the next ball. Better to cinch the shot and get so-so position, which still leaves you with the option of playing safe.
    10. Try to send the CB into a cluster at a point that will most likely spread the balls advantageously.
    11. When you can easily do so, avoid the narrow end of the position zone.
    12. Think three shots ahead.
    13. Have a plan, but reevaluate it after every shot.

<h2><strong>RULES OF Billiards?</strong></h2>
<p>In play, the object is to stroke the cue ball so that it hits the two object balls in succession, scoring a carom, or billiard, which counts one point. In a variety of the game called three-cushion billiards, the cue ball must also touch a cushion or cushions three or more times to complete a carom.</p>
<h2><strong>Billiard IS A TEAM GAME?</strong></h2>
<p>Most pool(billiards) games are player vs player or team vs team. This can be a problem when you have only two players of very un-equal skill levels or a few very good players and a few less skilled players. Me and my wife both like pool but I am quite a bit better than her. After a few games she can get discouraged losing every game. I wanted to make a game were any number of players can play and where everyone wins or loses together so it's truly a team experience.
    this game works with any number of players including playing alone.
    
    The concept:
    
    The concept of the game is, your team of however many players, is trying to reach their score limit before the table reaches its score limit.
    
    Score limits: The score Limits can be set to numbers that suit your teams skill level. My wife and I play so that we must reach a score of 60 and the table must reach a score of 15. If your unsure where to start I'd start with this score limit combo and adjust from there.
    
    Scoring:
    
    PLAYERS SCORE by pocketing balls. Any ball can be pocketed except the 8 ball. The 8 ball can be pocketed but only when there are no other balls remaining. The score you receive for pocketing a ball is equal to the number on the ball. For example, if you sink the 9 ball you receive 9 points.
    
    The TABLE SCORES by your mistakes. The table gets 1 point if no ball is pocketed on a shot, 2 points on a scratch, 4 points if you scratch by hitting the 8 ball and 8 points if you scratch by sinking the 8 ball.
    
    SCRATCH rules. If you scratch by sinking the white ball the table gets 2 points and the white ball is placed on the centre of the D line. If you sink a ball and scratch you only get half the points of the ball (rounded down) and the table gets 2 points.
    
    Players take turns back and forth, you don't continue taking shots after you sink a ball.
    
    On the brake, balls that are pocketed don't count towards your score and if no ball is pocketed the table does not receive any points. If you scratch on a brake the table doesn't receive any points either and the white ball is set back on the centre of the D.
    The brake has a bit of strategy to it. You don't want to pocket any balls because they don't count towards your score, on the other hand you want them broken up enough as to not make further shots to difficult.
    
    If you don't have a good shot or if the only shots are low scoring balls you can instead let the table have a point by intentionally not pocketing a ball but taking a shot that lines up your teammate to sink a high points ball.
    
    DIFFICULTY LEVEL:
    The most difficult score limits you could play this game with is the table needs a score of 1 and your team needs a score of 228. That would mean you need to pocket every ball, but none on the brake, and you must not miss a single shot. Like I said me and my wife play with the table needing a score of 15 and us needing a score of 60. Find what works for you and most of all have fun.

    <h2><strong>WHO INVENTED Billiards?</strong></h2>
<p>By 1850, the billiard table had essentially evolved into its current form. The dominant billiard game in Britain from about 1770 until the 1920's was English Billiards, played with three balls and six pockets on a large rectangular table.

    The history of billiards is long and very rich. The game has been played by kings and commoners, presidents, mental patients, ladies, gentlemen, and hustlers alike. It evolved from a lawn game similar to the croquet played sometime during the 15th century in Northern Europe and probably in France. Play was moved indoors to a wooden table with green cloth to simulate grass, and a simple border was placed around the edges. The balls were shoved, rather than struck, with wooden sticks called “maces”. The term “billiard” is derived from French, either from the word “billart”, one of the wooden sticks, or “bille”, a ball.
    
    The game was originally played with two balls on a six-pocket table with a hoop similar to a croquet wicket and an upright stick used as a target. During the 18th century, the hoop and target gradually disappeared, leaving only the balls and pockets. Most of our information about early billiards comes from accounts of playing by royalty and other nobles. It has been known as the “Noble Game of Billiards” since the early 1800’s, but there is evidence that people from all walks of life have played the game since its inception. In 1600, the game was familiar enough to the public that Shakespeare mentioned it in Antony and Cleopatra. Seventy-five years later, the first book of billiard rules remarked of England that there were “few Towns of note therein which hath not a publick Billiard-Table.”
    
    Mike Shamos is the author of The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Billiards and curator of The Billiard Archive, a nonprofit organization established to preserve the game‘s history.

<h2><strong>WHICH COUNTRY PLAY THE GAME?</strong></h2>
<p>The game of English billiards is most popular in Britain and the former empire countries. The game of pocket billiards, or pool, which uses six large pocket openings, is primarily the game played on the American continents and, in recent years, has been played in Japan.</p>
<h2><strong>THESE ARE SOME DETAILS OF Billiard.</strong></h2>
<p>The game of carom billiards is still played primarily in France and other European countries and to a lesser degree in the United States and has many players in Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and South Korea and in Central America, South America, Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<h2><strong>THESE ARE SOME RECORD AND STRATEGIES OF Billiard.</strong></h2>
<p>There are two main varieties of billiard games: carom and pocket. The main carom billiards games are straight rail, balkline and three cushion billiards. All are played on a pocketless table with three balls; two cue balls and one object ball.

    <h1><strong>World Billiards Championship (English billiards)</strong></h1>
<p>The World Billiards Championship is an international cue sports tournament in the discipline of English billiards, organised by World Billiards, a subsidiary of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). In its various forms, and usually as a single competition, the title is one of the oldest sporting world championships, having been contested (though irregularly) since 1870.

    From 2012 to 2014 there were separate timed and points divisions, with the tournament held in association with the International Billiards and Snooker Federation. In those years, there was no separate IBSF World Billiards Championship.
    
    The rules adopted by the Billiards Association in 1899 are essentially the rules still used today. The tournament has been played on a regular annual schedule since 1980, when it became administered by the WPBSA. The event was known as the World Professional Billiards Championship until 2010, and has had other names in the past, e.g. Billiards Championship of the World. In addition, the World Ladies Billiards Championship has been played since 1931 (with interruptions) and organized by World Ladies Billiards and Snooker since 1998.[1]
