            Swimming
        </strong>
        </h2>  
                <p>
                    The sport or activity of propelling oneself through water using the limbs.
            </p>
                
            <h2><strong>How many players play the game</strong></h2>
          <p>  Each team is allowed to have seven players in the water at any one time (six 'outfield' players and a goalkeeper). Other than the goalkeeper, you will see the other players moving continuously around the pool.  </p>
         <h2><strong> STRATEGY OF THE GAME?</strong></h2>
          Here are a few common race strategies seen at every meet:
          
          
          
          
        
         <h3>1. Fly and Die.</h3>

          The “fly and die” strategy is usually found in shorter events. It is the preferred strategy of sprint-oriented racers.  Sprinters tend to use this strategy for all events, regardless of the distance, to varying success. This strategy is not recommended for events over a 200 since it is difficult to maintain maximum speed for longer distances. Let’s be real, we have seen someone sprint the 200 butterfly and regret their decision in the last 50 yards.
          <h3>2. Sally/Sammy Save-Up.</h3>

          Every team has a swimmer that uses the Sally or Sammy save up strategy. Whether they negative split the 1000 freestyle or come home guns blazing in the last 50 of a 200, these swimmers have endurance for days. The save up strategy is useful for swimmers who can pace with ease, but may need a couple of laps to get into a rhythm. They don’t take a race out fast, but sure know how to race to the finish. This is not always the most efficient way to race, but it is necessary for a select few.
          <h3> 3. The Even Splitter.</h3>

          If you’ve ever watched a distance event there is always one swimmer that will consistently hold the same pace per 50, evenly splitting every 50. There are also those swimmers that will exactly even split the 1000 freestyle, not missing a beat on any 100. These swimmers are hard to come by. You might be thinking, who does that? Why is that a good race strategy? Usually these tactics are unplanned. A swimmer who evenly splits an event may need some more warmup prior to racing or instead go out faster
            
          <h2><strong>Rules for Competitive Swimming</strong></h3>
 
          As a competitive swimmer, you know referees will watch you closely as you propel yourself through the water to make sure you are swimming by the rules. You spend hours practicing and perfecting your form every week. While endurance and form are crucial to your performance, you should also understand the latest rules to make sure your practice is taking you in the right direction.
          <h2>Basic Rules of Competitive Swimming</h2>
          An organization called USA Swimming determines the rules and regulations of competitive swimming in the United States. The organization known as FINA sets the rules for international swimming competitions. Here are some of the basic swimming rules you should understand to help you practice and compete properly to avoid disqualification.
          <h5>1. Starts</h5>
          The referee begins by signaling competing swimmers with several short whistles. This lets them know it is time to begin the race. Swimmers will remove all clothing except their legal swimwear at this point. The referee then gives a long sound from their whistle to command swimmers to assume their starting positions. This can either be the starting platform, the deck or the water, depending on the race. 
          Once all officials and swimmers are ready for action, the referee signals to the starter with an outstretched hand. This gives the starter control over the swimmers. The starter will tell all swimmers to take their marks, and they will assume their forward-start positions. Specific rules for forward-start positions include:
          •	Swimmers starting outside the water must have at least one foot on the front of the starting platform or deck.
          •	Swimmers already in the water must continuously contact the starting platform or wall with one hand.
          Once all swimmers are in their starting positions, the starter gives the signal, and the race begins. If a swimmer doesn't immediately take their mark, the starter will command the swimmers to "stand up." Swimmers can disengage their starting position until they are once again told to take their marks.
         <h5> 2. False Starts</h5>
          False starts usually result in a swimmer's disqualification. The following are instances of false starts:
          •	A swimmer starts the race before the signal. Referees can call this before the signal is given or after the race has concluded. 
          •	A swimmer declares to the referee that they will not race. This is considered a false start.
          Starting upon hearing "stand up" does not result in disqualification. The swimmer can still legally compete in this situation. 
         <h5> 3. Disqualifications</h5>
          As a competitive swimmer, you compete for the first-place prize. Disqualifications remove any chance at achieving that goal for a given race. Here are acts you should avoid so you can compete legally and strive for the gold:
          •	Committing a false start
          •	Behaving in an unsportsmanlike or unsafe way
          •	Grabbing or physically hindering another swimmer
          •	Entering a pool before another race has been completed
          •	Dipping your goggles in the pool before a race
          •	Finishing the race in a different lane than you started
          •	Grabbing lane dividers
          •	Standing on the bottom of the pool, except during freestyle races
        <h2><strong>Is swimming a team game</strong></h2>
Yes it is a team game<br>
Most swimming races involve either eight or 10 swimmers, each competing in individual lanes in the pool.

<h2><strong>when game was invented</strong></h2>
<p>Swimming started its sporting journey in the mid-19th century, when the world's first swimming organisation was formed in London in 1837. Inevitably, things soon became competitive and, in 1846, the first swimming championship was held in Australia.

 <h2><strong>10 Best Swimmers In History</strong></h2>
 
 Every four years when the Olympics rolls around, one of the most eagerly anticipated, talked-about disciplines is swimming.
 <h5>10. Janet Evans</h5>
 Evans’ strong suit was long distance swimming and had several world records to her name throughout her career.
 .
 The winner of five Olympic medals (4 golds and 1 silver), Evans carried the torch in its last stretch and handed it over to Muhammad Ali during the opening ceremony of the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
<h5>9. Kristin Otto</h5>
  A fractured vertebra in 1985 meant Otto would have a tough battle to the top, but the German overcame any challenge in her way to arrive at the 1988 Seoul Olympics as one of the best swimmers in the world.
 All six of her Olympic medals were golds from the 1988 Games, and in doing so, she became the first female to win six golds at a single edition of the Olympics.
 Otto also set new world records in each of the 50m freestyle, 100m freestyle, 100m backstroke and 100m butterfly events, before retiring from swimming in 1989.
<h5>8. Ryan Lochte</h5>
 Despite acting a complete fool at the Rio 2016 games and getting himself into hot water with the American press, there is no disputing Lochte is among the best swimmers in history.
 The current holder of world records in each of the 100-metre, 200-metre and 400-metre individual medleys, Lochte gave stiff competition to fellow American Michael Phelps throughout their peak years in the sport.
 Now 33, Lochte has a magnificent collection of 12 Olympic medals (6 Golds, 3 silver and 3 bronze).
 The 5 ultimate Endurance sports
<h5> 7. Amy Van Dyken</h5>
  For Van Dyken, what began as a way to battle severe asthma culminated in six gold medals across two Olympic Games.
 In Atlanta 1996, Amy took the crown in the 50m freestyle, 100m butterfly, 4x100m freestyle and 4x100m medley to become the first American female to take home such a tally from a single Olympics.
 Having emerged as the most successful athlete in Atlanta, she returned to defend both of her team titles in Sydney 2000. Tied with German Kristin Otto as the second best female swimmer in Olympic history, Amy’s stats are behind only Jenny Thompson’s eight golds, none of which were won in an individual event.
<h5>6. Natalie Coughlin</h5>
 With 12 Olympic medals, Coughlin is tied with fellow swimmers Dara Torres and Jenny Thompson for the top spot of most-decorated female American Olympians.
 In Beijing 2008, Natalie became the first woman to defend the 10 m backstroke title at the Olympic Games after her earlier victory at the same event in Athens 2004. Also in 2008, she equalled the women’s Olympic record of winning the highest number of medals (6) in a single Games.
 With a 4×100 m freestyle bronze in London 2012, Natalie finally had 3 golds, 4 silvers and 5 bronze medals to show for her glittering Olympic career.
 See what some of world top athletes like to eat!
<h5>5. Dara Torres</h5>
  Torres staged her comeback after seven years away from the sport in Sydney 2000 and walked away from the International Aquatic Centre with two golds and three bronze medals to her name.
 A unique aspect of her outstanding tally of twelve Olympic medals (4 of each colour – gold, silver and bronze) is that she has won at least one medal in every single Games that she’d been a part of, in 1984, 1988, 1992, 2000 and 2008.
 We answer the age old question of
<h5>4. Ian Thorpe</h5>
 Australia’s most decorated Olympian Ian Thorpe provided the home audience with plenty to cheer for as he became the most successful athlete in the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
 Nicknamed ‘The Thorpedo’ for his blinding speed, the specialist in freestyle swimming captured 3 golds and 2 silvers in Sydney and went on to add 4 more medals, 2 of which were freestyle golds, to his cabinet at the 2004 Athens Olympics. The dominance that he exercised in the competitive arena in his favourite discipline for six years till his break after the Athens edition was a rare feat at the Olympic level.
 .
 The 10 healthiest sports you can do
<h5>3. Matt Biondi</h5>
  A member of the Swimming Hall of Fame and an Olympic legend, Biondi went to Seoul in 1988 with all guns blazing and steamrolled his competitors to clinch 7 straight medals, 5 of which were golds, creating four new world records in the process.
 .
 Two more team golds and an individual freestyle silver in Barcelona in 1992, Matt retired shortly after the Games with a spectacular count of 11 Olympic medals from three editions (8 golds, 2 silvers and 1 bronze).
<h5>2. Mark Spitz</h5>
 The majestic feat of seven straight golds at a single Olympics that Mark Spitz achieved in 1972 in Munich took 36 years to be repeated and bettered, and the man who did it was none other than Michel Phelps at Beijing 2008.
 Living up to the immense hype that had surrounded him ahead of the 1972 Games, ‘Mark the Shark’ swept the swimming events in Munich, setting a new world record in all seven of his conquered races – a record that has not been paralleled since.
 Although his attempt to resurface in Olympic swimming in 1992 at the age of 41 didn’t yield any medals, Spitz goes down in history as a legend who won 11 medals, nine of them being golds, 
  
<h5>1. Michael Phelps</h5>
  When it comes to recounting the accomplishments of uncontested GOAT Michael Phelps at the Olympic Games, finding sufficient words is a challenge in itself. In Sydney 2000, being a member of the swimming powerhouse United States team at the age of 15 happened to be the first of a plethora of records that he was about to set.
 Chasing Mark Spitz’s 1972 Munich tally of seven straight golds, Phelps contested eight different events in Athens 2004 but fell short by one, largely attributed to his third-place finish behind Ian Thorpe and Pieter van den Hoogenband in what was touted as the Race of the Century in the 200-metre freestyle.

<h1>Shields, McKeon tops overall, Sates with 5 golds</h1>

USA’s Tom Shields and Aussie Emma McKeon finished atop in the Budapest overall ranks to bag 12,000 USD apiece. Shields not only completed a butterfly treble but on the last day he won the 50m fly and the 100m back in a span of fifteen minutes. McKeon crowned her performance in Budapest with a tied World Cup record in the 100m free, the best individual effort of the meet which also secured her a third gold here. South Africa’s Matthew Sates landed two more titles to finish the week with a perfect 5/5 – the 18 year-old now leads the overall for the series among the men.

Matthew Sates completed the IM treble (100-200-400) again, so he is 6/6 so far this season in the medley events. Today he was again a cut above the rest in the 400m, thus he managed to repeat the feat of fellow South African Chad le Clos from 2011 – ten years ago Chad made the treble at back-to-back editions, in Beijing and Singapore. 
Coming first in six straight medley events is a rare achievement, beside Le Clos, Brazil’s Thiago Pereira did it in 2007 (Stockholm and Berlin), Germany’s Jinka Letzin in 2001 (Rio and College Park), China’s Xian Xufeng in 2000 (Shanghai, Hong Kong), Dutchman Marcel Wouda in 1997 (Gelsenkirchen, Imperia) and Germany’s Christian Keller in 1994 (Hong Kong, Beijing). But no one managed to make it three times – it’s up to Sates to show up in Kazan at the end of the month to write history.

Sates, just like in Berlin, came back later, and grabbed the 200m free title too – it was a brilliant race where he out-touched Aussie Kylie Chalmers by 0.11sec. Thus, Sates finished with a clean sheet of 5 gold medals in as many starts and stands with 9 golds and a silver after the first two legs.
However, the overall scoring is based on the top three results only where the FINA Points make the difference among the multiple gold medallists. Sates was a bit faster in Berlin so there he topped the ranks – now it was Tom Shields who offered a bit more quality and that helped him to claim the overall title in this leg.
Well, Shields enjoyed an outstanding meet, he clinched all three butterfly titles (the last time Le Clos achieved that in Doha 2017). But the most amazing feat of all was his Saturday double when he snatched the 50m fly and the 100m back victories in a span of 15 minutes (only the women’s 200m back final was held between the two).

All credits go to Shields who, as a brilliant butterflier, held on despite he had to live in the shadow of Michael Phelps, and once the great one finished, entered Caeleb Dressel for the shorter distances, while the Hungarians, headed by Kristof Milak, flooded the 200m. So an unbeaten run in this stroke in Budapest has a special value – as Tom said when asked how he could keep up in the company of such giants.

In the women’s competition Emma McKeon now didn’t miss the 50m fly gold (she had in Berlin) – so she made the ‘sprinting’ treble, and she was indeed speeding while winning the 50m-100m free and the 50m fly. Compared to Berlin, the Aussie hero of the Tokyo Olympics had even more fire and today she managed to tie the World Cup record (50.58) set by Sarah Sjostrom in 2017. It was a 980 pointer in the FINA table – the best individual effort of the week and that also put her on the top of the overall ranks here and she now also leads the combined overall where first place earns you 100,000 USD at the end.


 Image Source: Emma McKeon came up with the best individual effort on the last day as she tied the World Cup record in the 100m free
There was another triple, Kira Toussaint could grab all backstroke titles for the first time in her World Cup career. In Berlin the Dutchwoman missed the 50m, now she had all three, and each came after brilliant swims (Aussie Emily Seebohm swept the backstroke golds in Tokyo 2019 for the last time).
As for the other events, Nika Godun added the 50m breast to her 100m title, the Russian managed to beat Olympic champion Lydia Jacoby of the US once more. USA’s Cavan Gormsen retained her 800m title from Berlin, compatriot Linnea Mack managed to upend Maria Ugolkova of Switzerland for the 100m fly gold (she had been fourth a week ago, while Ugolkova third). The Swiss then returned to grab the last female event in the programme, the 200m IM – she did in a convincing style, gained almost two seconds on Ilaria Cusinato, Italian winner of the 400m.

The meet ended in a junior World Record swim again, the young US quartet beat their own mark set in Berlin (1:41.21) – there it had been enough for the silver, now it was worth gold.
The FINA Swimming World Cup series resume in little less than three weeks in Kazan (RUS), on 27-29 October.




<h2><strong>top 10 Swim Meets to Watch in 2022:</strong></h2> 
<h3>1. Women’s NCAA Championships, March 16-19 — Atlanta</h3>
This year’s college championship season should be an exciting one as the defending-champion Virginia Cavaliers face off against the team that won the three prior national championship meets, Stanford. Virginia’s roster will include three swimmers who won individual medals at the Tokyo Olympics, Alex Walsh, Kate Douglass and Emma Weyant, while Stanford adds three Tokyo medalists from last year’s group (Regan Smith, Torri Huske and Taylor Ruck) to its squad led by fifth-year senior Brooke Forde. Expect an intense dual between those two squads. Michigan senior’s Maggie MacNeil, the Olympic and world champion in the 100-meter butterfly and the fastest swimmer ever in the 100-yard butterfly, will look to conclude her college career in fine style while U.S. Olympians such as Rhyan White, Phoebe Bacon and Erica Sullivan should all be in contention for individual titles. Transgender swimmer Lia Thomas figures to enter NCAAs among the favorites in the mid-distance and distance freestyle events.

<h3>2. Men’s NCAA Championships, March 23-26 — Atlanta</h3>

One week after the women’s meet, the men’s NCAA Championships should be a Texas Longhorns show. Olympian Drew Kibler and Short Course World Championships medalist Carson Foster lead a group stacked with talent in virtually every event except the butterflys (including Caspar Corbeau, Danny Krueger, Carson’s older brother Jake Foster and emerging swimmers like Cameron Auchinachie). But the California Golden Bears never go down without a fight, and they will look to continue their streak of top-two finishes which goes back to 2010. Florida will have a pair of stars in U.S. Olympic medalists Kieran Smith and Bobby Finke, and those two figure to give the American record books a real shake.

<h3>3. Australian Swimming Championships, April 4-9 — Adelaide, South Australia</h3>
The World Championships qualification meets will kick off in full force in April, and Australia’s meet is always a big one, particularly following Australia’s resurgent performance at the Tokyo Olympics. Expect to see all three of Australia’s double individual gold medalists from Tokyo, sprinter Emma McKeon, mid-distance star Ariarne Titmus and backstroker Kaylee McKeown, in action, and we will get a chance at this meet to see how Australia’s team is looking for the first post-Tokyo global championships. A lot can change over the course of a three-year stretch between Tokyo and Paris, and this will be the first chance to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the Aussie team.

<h3>4. USA Swimming International Team Trials, April 26-30 — Greensboro, N.C.</h3>
The past four quads have seen the first major U.S. squads selected at Nationals in Indianapolis, but this year sees a change as a major selection meet heads to Greensboro for the first time. The U.S. stars of the Tokyo Olympics figure to be back in action, from five-time gold medalist Caeleb Dressel to the legendary Katie Ledecky and many more. No top Americans have declared their intention to retire or to skip the 2022 championship season, so we should expect most familiar faces to be in town. We will also see plenty of college-aged swimmers trying to break onto the No. 1 U.S. squad for the first time as the new Olympic cycle begins. USA Swimming’s non-Olympic selection meets follow a five-day, prelims-finals only format, unlike the eight-day Olympic Trials which include semifinals, so this one will go by quicker with the World Championships set to follow less than a month later.

<h3>5. FINA World Championships, May 22-29 — Fukuoka, Japan</h3>

Make no mistake, this is the big one for 2022. The best swimmers in the world will gather for an eight-day showcase, the stakes slightly lowered from the Olympics but still with valuable World Championships hardware on the line. Legacies are made at the Olympics, but in the grand scheme of swimming, World Championship honors matter, too. So this will be the first chance to see how all of the world’s top swimmers stack up in this new quad leading up to Paris. Some veterans may be a little off in the post-Olympic year as they begin a slow build-up toward the next Games, while plenty of young swimmers will be eager to fill their spots and take away medals. Expect to see individual Olympic champion from Tokyo competing in Fukuoka. And if you need a reminder of the importance of the post-Olympic World Championships, remember this: the 2017 World Championships saw Caeleb Dressel emerge as a star for the first time as he won seven gold medals, while future Australian stars Ariarne Titmus and Kaylee McKeown both earned fourth-place finishes in individual events in the first major international meet of their careers.

<h3>6. Commonwealth Games, July 29-August 3 (swimming) — Birmingham, England</h3>
The World Championships will not be the lswimast major meet of the year for most of the world’s elite swimmers, and the stretch of the late-summer championships kicks off with the Commonwealth Games in England. This meet features swimmers from the Commonwealth nations of England, Scotland, Wales, Australia, Canada, South Africa and more. Three swimmers per country can race in each event, leaving open the possibility for one country (typically Australia) to sweep all three podium spots. Note that Great Britain competes as three different nations here, so Duncan Scott will represent Scotland while Adam Peaty, Tom Dean and most other big-name British swimmers swim for England.

<h3>7. European Championships, August 11-17 (swimming) — Rome</h3>
The best swimmers in Europe will race at the Foro Italico, the iconic outdoor venue that hosted the 1994 and 2009 World Championships. Europe’s top men’s swimmers were dominant at the Olympics, with Russian and Italian swimmers taking a notable step forward, while Europe’s women will be looking for a significant bounce-back this year after they won just four medals (none of them gold) in Tokyo. This is typically the most prestigious meet of the summer for European swimmers in the middle year of the quad, but because of the World Championships happening just a few months before, we’ll see if any of the top swimmers on the continent choose to skip this meet or perhaps swim off-events. The participation of top British swimmers is especially questionable since they will have already raced at both the World Championships and the Commonwealth Games before the European meet.

<h3>8. Asian Games, September 11-16 (swimming) — Hangzhou, China</h3>

This is typically a significant championship affair for the top swimmers in Asia, so we should expect top swimmers from China and Japan to highlight the Asian Games along with stars such as Siobhan Haughey of Hong Kong and Hwang Sunwoo of South Korea. China’s swimmers, in particular, tend to excel while racing in home waters, so this could be a huge meet for that squad. Tokyo gold medalists Zhang Yufei and Wang Shun of China and Yui Ohashi of Japan should be expected to compete, along with star Japanese IMer Daiya Seto. We should also expect to see Rikako Ikee back in top form by this point following her battle with leukemia. She could win an individual medal at the World Championships, but she may star at the Asian Games after she captured six gold medals at the 2018 edition of the meet.

<h3>9. FINA Short Course World Championships, December 17-22 — Kazan, Russia</h3>
For the first time ever, FINA will hold its signature World Championships featuring all aquatic sports and the Short Course World Championships in the same year. Short Course Worlds will also be held in back-to-back years for the first time since 1999 and 2000. As we saw with the recent edition of Short Course Worlds in Abu Dhabi, the top swimmers in the world do not always show up for this meet, but we should see a greater turnout than we did in 2021 in the immediate aftermath of the Olympics. Siobhan Haughey, Maggie MacNeil and Florian Wellbrock all set individual world records at the 2021 edition of the event.
<h3>10. International Swimming League, TBD</h3>
The ISL has announced plans to return for a fourth season in 2022, but it is unclear when and where that will take place. We might not know details for a while as the league only announced the location and date for the 2021 final about one month in advance. Energy Standard captured the 2021 league title in a close final against the Cali Condors, and Cali will certainly be out for revenge in 2022, while the league will be looking for some parity after the same four squads (Energy, Cali, London Roar and LA Current) have qualified for the final in each of the league’s first three seasons. The ISL is still looking for some stability, but it has been an exciting edition to swimming’s calendar over the past three years for both athletes and fans.
