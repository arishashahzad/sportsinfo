            <h2> <strong>Judo Rules & Judo Techniques</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Three referees officiate a judo contest, which takes place on a Judo mat. The goal is to score an ippon, or one complete point, which may be done in four different methods and finishes the match instantly. One method is to pin the opponent on the back for 25 seconds while retaining control of the head and shoulder. Another technique to win is to use an arm lock, which involves putting pressure on the elbow of a straight arm or twisting an arm bent at a right angle until the opponent yields. Choking is a third technique to win. Apply pressure on the sides of the opponent’s neck, but not the windpipe, until the opponent submits. The final technique to get an ippon is to toss an opponent and make a forceful landing on the back.

            <h2> <strong>Judo History</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Judo Origin: The samurai, a class of professional soldiers, governed Japan from the twelfth through the eighteenth centuries. This offered ideal ground for the development of numerous martial arts. The samurai created jujitsu to combat adversaries at close quarters on the battlefield, in addition to battling with swords and bows and arrows. Jujitsu grew into several other schools, and hand-to-hand fighting became a popular method of military training.
Jigoro Kano, a Japanese schoolteacher, invented Judo in 1882. The sport grew from a combination of wrestling and jiu-jitsu to become its own martial art. Jigoro Kano dedicated his life to the advancement and propagation of judo across the world. He was a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and his efforts to establish judo as a worldwide sport led to its inclusion in the Olympic Games in 1964.
Medals were given to participants in several weight classes, and Japanese athletes swept the gold in all events except the open division, which was won by a non-Japanese competitor. This indicated that judo has already spread outside of Japan. Women’s judo game debuted as a demonstration event in the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
