                Football
            </strong>
            </h2>   
            <p>
                    Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football. These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.
            There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century. The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire. By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage. In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.

                    <h2> <strong> Game rules </strong></h2>
                    <h3>Football (Soccer) Rules</h3>
                    <p>Football (Soccer) is one of the oldest sports in the world and with that; it’s also one of the most recognised. The pinnacle of the international game comes in the form the Football World Cup. There is also tournament such as the Euro Championships, Copa America and the African Cup of Nations. Domestically the strongest leagues come from England (English Premier League), Spain (La Liga), Italy (Serie A) and Germany (Bundesliga). In parts of the world the sport is also known as Soccer.</p>
                    <h3>Object of the Game</h3>
                    <p>
                        The aim of football is to score more goals then your opponent in a 90-minute playing time frame. The match is split up into two halves of 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes players will take a 15-minute rest period called half time. The second 45 minutes will resume and any time deemed fit to be added on by the referee (injury time) will be accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How many players play the game</h3>
                    <p>A match is played by two teams, each with a maximum of eleven players; one must be the goalkeeper. A match may not start or continue if either team has fewer than seven players.
            
                    If a team has fewer than seven players because one or more players has deliberately left the field of play, the referee is not obliged to stop play and the advantage may be played, but the match must not resume after the ball has gone out of play if a team does not have the minimum number of seven players.
                    
                    If the competition rules state that all players and substitutes must be named before kick-off and a team starts a match with fewer than eleven players, only the players and substitutes named in the starting line-up may take part in the match upon their arrival.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Players & Equipment</h3>
                    <p>Each team consists of 11 players. These are made up of one goalkeeper and ten outfield players. The pitch dimensions vary from each ground but are roughly 120 yards long and 75 yards wide. On each pitch you will have a 6-yard box next to the goal mouth, an 18-yard box surrounding the 6-yard box and a centre circle. Each half of the pitch must be a mirror image of the other in terms of dimensions.
                        Essentially the equipment that is needed for a soccer match is pitch and a football. Additionally, players can be found wearing studded football boots, shin pads and matching strips. The goalkeepers will additionally wear padded gloves as they are the only players allowed to handle the ball. Each team will have a designated captain.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Scoring</h3>
                    <p>
                        To score the ball must go into your opponent’s goal. The whole ball needs to be over the line for it to be a legitimate goal. A goal can be scored with any part of the body apart from the hand or arm up to the shoulder. The goal itself consists of a frame measuring 8 feet high and 8 yards wide.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
                    <p>
                        To win you have to score more goals than that of your opponents. If the scores are level after 90 minutes then the game will end as a draw apart from in cup games where the game can go to extra time and even a penalty shootout to decide the winner. Players must use their feet to kick the ball and are prohibited to use their hands apart from goalkeepers who can use any part of their body within the 18-yard box (of which more can be found out in the next section).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Rules of Football (Soccer)</h3>
                    <p>A match consists of two 45 minutes halves with a 15-minute rest period in between.
                        Each team can have a minimum off 11 players (including 1 goalkeeper who is the only player allowed to handle the ball within the 18-yard box) and a minimum of 7 players are needed to constitute a match.
                        The field must be made of either artificial or natural grass. The size of pitches is allowed to vary but must be within 100-130 yards long and 50-100 yards wide. The pitch must also be marked with a rectangular shape around the outside showing out of bounds, two six-yard boxes, two 18-yard boxes and a centre circle. A spot for a penalty placed 12 yards out of both goals and centre circle must also be visible.
                        The ball must have a circumference of 58-61cm and be of a circular shape.
                        Each team can name up to 7 substitute players. Substitutions can be made at any time of the match with each team being able to make a maximum of 3 substitutions per side. In the event of all three substitutes being made and a player having to leave the field for injury the team will be forced to play without a replacement for that player.
                        Each game must include one referee and two assistant referee’s (linesmen). It’s the job of the referee to act as time keeper and make any decisions which may need to be made such as fouls, free kicks, throw ins, penalties and added on time at the end of each half. The referee may consult the assistant referees at any time in the match regarding a decision. It’s the assistant referee’s job to spot offside’s in the match (see below), throw ins for either team and also assist the referee in all decision-making processes where appropriate.
                        If the game needs to head to extra time as a result of both teams being level in a match then 30 minutes will be added in the form of two 15-minute halves after the allotted 90 minutes.
                        If teams are still level after extra time then a penalty shootout must take place.
                        The whole ball must cross the goal line for it to constitute as a goal.
                        For fouls committed a player could receive either a yellow or red card depending on the severity of the foul; this comes down to the referee’s discretion. The yellow is a warning and a red card is a dismissal of that player. Two yellow cards will equal one red. Once a player is sent off then they cannot be replaced.
                        If a ball goes out of play off an opponent in either of the side lines then it is given as a throw in. If it goes out of play off an attacking player on the base line then it is a goal kick. If it comes off a defending player it is a corner kick.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Offside Rule in Football</h3>    
                        <p>
                            Offside can be called when an attacking player is in front of the last defender when the pass is played through to them. The offside area is designed to discourage players from simply hanging around the opponent’s goal waiting for a pass. To be onside they must be placed behind the last defender when the ball is played to them. If the player is in front of that last defender then he is deemed to be offside and free kick to the defending team will be called.
                            A player cannot be caught offside in their own half. The goalkeeper does not count as a defender. If the ball is played backwards and the player is in front of the last defender then he is deemed to be not offside.

                        <h2><strong>History of Football</strong></h2>
                        <p>The history of football is a complex one, but what is it you really need to know about one of the world’s most-loved and supported sports? We’ve detailed some of the key facts about football’s history so you can understand how the sport has developed since day dot.
                        </p>
                        <h3>WHERE IT ALL STARTED</h3>
                        <p>The origins of football can be split into two categories: contemporary history and classical history.
                            THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY: WHERE & WHEN WAS FOOTBALL INVENTED?
                            Football’s modern origins began in England more than 100 years ago, in 1863. Rugby football and association football, once the same thing, went their separate ways and the Football Association, the first official governing body for the sport, was established.
                            </p>
                        <h3>GOING BACK IN TIME</h3>
                        <p>History books dictate that people having had a brilliant time kicking a ball around for thousands of years, but not all those games would be recognisable as what we consider football today. But the different periods of football, or sports involving kicking a ball in more accurate terms, were all crucial to the development of the game. Without the variation experienced over the years, we may have never had football by modern standards.
                            The furthest back we can track football’s history is to China, as early as the third century BC, where there are mentions of a game resembling football in military manuals. The Han Dynasty played a game called Tus’ Chu, which involved kicking a ball through a 30-40cm opening and into what we’d now see as a goal make of canes with a net attached to it. The ball used during these games was made from leather and filled with hair and feathers.
                            The Greek’s invented ‘Harpastum’, a game which used a ball smaller than that used in football but that had similar rules to the modern game. Play was on a rectangular field marked by boundaries and a centre line and the aim was for one team to get the ball over their competitor’s boundary line.
                            Based on what we know about the history of ball games where use of feet dominates, we can see clearly the affect different cultures and variations have had on the game we play today.
                            </p>
                        <h3>BRITAIN AND FOOTBALL</h3>
                            <p>Records show that, in 1314, the Lord Mayor of London banned football in the city due to it causing ‘chaos’. If you were caught playing the game in London, you could be imprisoned. This was elaborated on during the 100 years England and France were at war, when Kings Edward II, Richard II, Henry IV and Henry V made the game illegal throughout the UK due to it ‘taking away focus from practising military disciplines’, which were deemed more useful.
                                Despite opposition for the game, football thrived in Britain from the eight to 19th centuries, however, a standardised version of the game was still a rarity as regional versions often gained favour. These different versions of the game were neatened up to eventually become association football, rugby football and Gaelic football, all of which contributed to the contemporary equivalent of the game we play today.
                                When thinking of the Sunday leagues we now play, the best iteration is village vs village games where villages gathered and their teams played against each other, usually on unmarked fields.
                                </p>
                        <h3>THE STANDARDISATION OF THE BALL</h3>
                        <p>Even though the official rules of modern football were dictated in 1863 when the Football Association was established, the specifications of the ball were not standardised for another eight years. Up until then, both parties playing would agree what ball was to be used amongst themselves.</p>
                        <h3>WHY IS A MATCH 90 MINS LONG?</h3>
                        <p>The standard length of game in football is 90 minutes. This duration was established for the first time in 1866 when London and Sheffield played against one another. For one reason or another, from here onward, 90 minutes was set as the standard duration for football games. Although, modern underage games do not use the 90-minute format.</p>
                        <h3>FOOTBALL, THE GLOBAL PHENOMENON</h3>
                        <p>It wasn’t until the start of the 19th century that playing football in schools became the norm, starting in public schools. While rules did not differ greatly to the standard, many schools would come up with their own variation of the game depending on the grounds they had available. For example, if a school only had a concrete playground, which was true of many schools, they had to work with what they had and would adapt the boundaries accordingly.
                            Eight years after it was founded, The Football Association had established 50-member clubs. That’s when, in 1872, the FA Cup was born, with the first championship in the works by 1888. At this time, Europe still hadn’t embraced the contemporary variant of football, which helped to define football as a ‘very British sport.’ However, preceding this in 1872 was the first ‘international’ football match between England and Scotland which attracted enormous crowds, much like today’s games.
                            The spread of football outside the UK was slow at first, but it soon reached every corner of the world. The Netherlands and Denmark formed their own football associations in 1889, followed by New Zealand in 1891, Argentina in 1893, and Chile, Switzerland and Belgium in 1895. Italy was next, forming its association in 1898. Behind it was Germany and Uruguay in 1900. The next decade would see Hungary and Finland form associations, too.
                            </p>
                        <h2><strong>THE FOUNDING OF FIFA</strong></h2>
                        <p>The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was established in Paris in 1904. Its founding members included Belgium, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Stanley Rous, who went on to become FIFA President, wrote the laws of football and put rational to them in 1886. They were re-drafted in 1997.
                            By the 1950s, after the Second World War, there were more than 73 FIFA members.
                            </p>
                            <h4>HOW MANY FOOTBALL CLUBS ARE THERE IN THE WORLD?</h4>
                        <p>At the end of the 2007 FIFA Congress, FIFA had 208 members throughout the world. It’s almost impossible to tell how many football clubs there are in the world, but we can tell you that there are more than 600 clubs in England alone. The mathematics say that there are hundreds of thousands of clubs worldwide, and that number’s ever increasing.</p>
                        
                        <h2><strong>Top 10 Unbeatable Records</strong></h2>
                        <p>Records are meant to be broken. It is a famous saying, but whoever said it has perhaps not been privy to these football records. Certain records are meant to stand the test of time, immortalised in their glory and accomplishment.
                            These are records that would require superhuman efforts to break, the kind that regular players would even shudder to think of. Here's a list of 10 such records that will never be broken.
                            </p>
                            <h3>1. Most goals in a single World Cup</h3>
                            <center><img src="img/10 rec/1r.jpg" alt="rec"></center>
                            <p>
                                Fontaine scored 13 goals in a single World Cup campaign
                                In most World Cups, scoring 5 or 6 goals would be enough to secure the golden boot, but it wasn't enough in the 1958 edition. In his first, and what would be his only, World Cup, Just Fontaine smashed all kinds of goalscoring records, scoring an impressive 13 goals en route to France's third-place finish.
                                The highest goals scored in World Cups stands at 16. Fontaine managed 13 in only one edition. As of now, the Frenchman is fourth in the list of most goals at the World Cup, but the record for goals scored in a single edition will likely always be his.
            
                            </p>
                            <h3>2. Most international goals</h3>
                            <center><img src="img/10 rec/22.jpg" alt=""></center>
                            <p>Ali Daei holds the record for most goals scored in international matches, with 109 goals for Iran
                                Ali Daei holds the record for most goals scored in international matches. In a career spanning 13 years and 149 matches, Daei managed to score an impressive 109 goals for Iran.
                                During his incredible career, he managed to play for giants such as Bayern Munich and Hertha BSC. He was handpicked by Beckenbauer as a world-class forward when he was signed for the German giants. During his stay in Bayern, he also became the first Asian player to play in the UEFA Champions League. 
                                He is the only player to have crossed the century mark for goals in international football, and it will take a superhuman effort to match or even break his record. 
                                With 102 international goals to his name as things stand, Cristiano Ronaldo should break the record in the coming years. The Portuguese attackers is one of the greatest footballers of all time and his ludicrous goalscoring exploits over the years makes him the highest-scoring international player in world football currently.
                                </p>
                            <h3>3. Winning the Champions League with a squad consisting entirely of local players</h3>
                                <center><img src="img/10 rec/3r.jpg" alt=""></center>
                                <p>Celtic won the European Cup with just local players in their team
                                    Celtic won the European Cup in 1967 with a team consisting of players born and raised in the vicinity of the stadium. Dubbed the Lisbon lions, they won the European Cup after beating Internazionale 2-1 in the final at Estadio Nacional. It was a 15-man squad, 14 of whom were born within 10 miles of Celtic Park and one born within 20 miles. 
                                    The victory was compounded by the style in which they dominated the tournament. The Lions were known to be an expansive team, able to play with great enthusiasm. This victory will go down in history as the most complete and convincing, having achieved the intended purpose of association football – to groom local talent and increase the stature of the locality. 
                                    This incredible achievement will never be replicated, with globalisation taking its effect on football and fans' increasing fervour for expensive signings. It is a record that is assured of its standing in history. 
                                    </p>
                            <h3>4. Most appearances over a career</h3>
                            <center><img src="img/10 rec/4r.jpg" alt=""></center>
                            <p>Rogerio Ceni made 1217 appearances for Sao Paolo and Brazil
                                Names like Pele, Romario and Gerd Muller will surely be brought up in any discussion about this record. Unfortunately, people who disseminate this fact are, more often than not, wrong. Pele has played a lot more than any of his counterparts, 1375 games, but that is including exhibition matches and matches at amateur, junior and reserve level. The official number stands at 1115, which is a huge total, but still not the most by a player.
                                The record for most appearances over a career is held by, free-scoring goalkeeper, Rogerio Ceni. Throughout his career, he made 1217 appearances. This astonishing fact is made even more bewildering when you find out that all these appearances came from playing for only one club, with a few appearances for his country also sprinkled in.
                                Ceni was at Sao Paulo from 1992 till 2015, and it is amazing how he managed to stay at one club and play at a consistent level to be their first choice for so long.

                                <p>Derby County were one of the most underwhelming PL sides in history
                                    This unwanted record is held by Derby County. The 2007/08 season was a well-fought, competitive season – at least for 19 of the teams. The 20th team, Derby County, was something of a letdown.
                                    Throughout 38 games, Derby managed to win only one game – against Newcastle. They lost 29 games (another record), scored 20 goals and conceded, an overwhelming, 89 goals and finished the season with only 11 points (another, heart-shattering record). 
                                    This has to be one of the most soul-crushing records any team could hope for. It is unlikely that any team is going to be this bad.

                                <p>A match played in Madagascar finished with a scoreline of 149-0
                                    The match between AS Adema and SO l'Emyrne played on 31 October 2002 has been immortalised by the Guinness book of world records for producing the biggest scoreline in club football. 
                                    The match, played in Madagascar, was a part of a four-team round-robin tournament to determine the national champion. SO l'Emyrne, dismayed at poor refereeing in a previous match, which effectively ended their hopes of becoming champions, took to the match to protest against biased refereeing. A most unusual protest.
                                    As soon as the whistle went, the SO l'Emyrne players proceeded to pass back to their own goal and score. The opposition were bewildered, but the team had made their mind.
                                    They went on to score 149 own goals leading to a score of 149-0. In the aftermath of the match, the SO l'Emyrne manager was banned from the game for three years, and 4 of the team players were banned until the end of the season.

                                    <p>The 1950 WC Final in Brazil
                                        The 1950 World Cup final – Brazil versus Uruguay. The event most commonly remembered for the huge upset – dubbed Maracanazo – is also remembered for hosting the highest number of people in a football game. 
                                        The official attendance is listed at 173,850 tickets sold, but unofficial estimates claim that almost 210,000 people were in that stadium. Ticket policies and safety concerns were a little more reserved in 1950 than it is today. This was taken full advantage of, and people managed to cram in and fill the stadium more than was maximum capacity. 
                                        Stadium disasters since 1950 have seen a shift in public perception of safety and has helped enforce stricter regulations on match-going crowds. The colossal crowd seen on that fateful day will never be possible again.

                                <h3>8. 5 European Cups in a row</h3>
                                <center><img src="img/10 rec/8r.jpg" alt=""></center>
                                <p>Real Madrid have 13 Champions League trophies currently
                                    From 1955 to 1960, Real Madrid went on a rampage, destroying teams en route to their five consecutive European Cups. It is from this their obsession with the Champions League stems. 
                                    During those five years, Madrid enjoyed a stranglehold over European football unlike any other and set them on their path to become the greatest European side ever. 
                                    The European Cup's modern equivalent, the Champions League, has yet to be defended even once. Forget five times; teams can't even manage to win it twice continuously. Even distinctly powerful teams like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich have failed.
                                    This record is immortal and will never be broken.

                                <p>Josef Bican is one of the greatest goalscorers of all time
                                    Most football fans mistakenly attribute this record to Pele, but Pele is not even second on this list. The record is held by a lesser-known player named Josef Bican.
                                    The football calendar back then was more relaxed, thus enabling the longevity of players' careers. It is almost impossible for players to survive a 1000 games in the modern era.
                                    Even if they did come close to 1000 games, like Giggs and Paolo Maldini, it would be impossible to maintain Bican's scoring rate, which was an unbelievable 1.6 goals per game.

                                <center><img src="img/10 rec/10r.jpg" alt=""></center>
                                <p>Rogerio Ceni was a goalscoring goalkeeper
                                    Goalkeepers are mostly one-dimensional players. They have one, and only one job on the field – at least only one that invites deep scrutiny – keep the ball out of the net. It is a tremendous task in itself, but what happens when a goalkeeper adds another dimension to his play; a flair for goal scoring? Well, ladies and gentlemen, the answer is simple: Rogerio Ceni.
                                    Ceni was a Brazilian goalkeeper who plied his trade for Sao Paulo. He was an excellent goalkeeper and even represented his country at two World Cups. He was also extraordinarily good at set-pieces.
                                    In a career spanning two-and-a-half decades, Ceni scored 131 goals. That is more than 60 goals more than the second most goal-rich keeper in history, Jose Luis Chilavert. To put this extraordinary feat into perspective, Ryan Giggs, an attacking player, has scored only 111 goals in the same period that Ceni started taking set pieces for his team.
                                    Following his retirement, Ceni became the manager of Sao Paulo. His record might still burgeon, but irrespective of his future exploits, his record as the best scoring goalkeeper will surely stand the test of time.
