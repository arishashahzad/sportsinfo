                    </h1>    
                    <p>
                            Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players.
                    </p>
                    <h2> <strong>    How many players play the game? </strong></h2>
            
                    Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players. As there are 11 players on a team and 2 of them must be the bowler and wicketkeeper, only 9 other positions can be occupied at any one time.

                    <h2><strong> Strategy of the game</strong></h2>
                    
                <h3>  Strategy and technique</h3>
                <p>
                    The objectives of the captain of the fielding side are:
                     (1) to place his men in positions where the batsman may give a catch, i.e., hit a drive or a fly ball to a fielder and (2) to save runs, i.e., to block the path of the ball from the batsman’s scoring strokes (intercept or trap grounders). 
                    As there are 11 players on a team and 2 of them must be the bowler and wicketkeeper, only 9 other positions can be occupied at any one time. The field is spoken of as being divided lengthwise into off and on, or leg, sides in relation to the batsmen’s stance, depending upon whether he bats right- or left-handed; the off side is the side facing the batsman, and the on, or leg, side is the side behind him as he stands to receive the ball. The fieldsmen will reposition themselves at the end of each over and will adjust the field for a left- or right-handed batsman.</p>
                  <h3> Bowling</h3>
                   <p>Bowling can be right- or left-arm. For a fair delivery, the ball must be propelled, usually overhand, without bending the elbow. The bowler may run any desired number of paces as a part of his delivery (with the restriction, of course, that he not cross the popping crease). The ball generally hits the ground (the pitch) before reaching the batsman, although it need not. The first requisite of a good bowler is command of length—i.e., the ability to pitch (bounce) the ball on a desired spot, usually at or slightly in front of the batsman’s feet. The location varies with the pace of the bowler, the state of the pitch, and the reach and technique of the batsman.</p>
                <h3> Batting</h3>
                <p>    A batsman may hit right-handed or left-handed. Good batting is based on a straight (i.e., vertical) bat with its full face presented to the ball, although a cross (i.e., horizontal) bat can be used effectively to deal with short bowling. 
                    The ideal fieldsman is a fast runner with quick reactions and the ability to throw quickly and accurately. He should be able to anticipate the batsman’s strokes, to move quickly to cut off the ball in its path, and to judge the flight of the ball in the air to make a safe catch.</p>
                   <h3> Wicketkeeping</h3>
                <p>    The wicketkeeper is a key member of the fielding side. He takes position behind the striker’s wicket, 10 to 20 yards back for the fast bowlers or directly behind for those of slower pace. He must concentrate on every ball, being ready to stop a ball that passes the wicket, to stump a batsman if he leaves his ground, or to receive a ball returned to him by a fielder.</p>
           <h2><strong>Is it a team game</strong></h2>
<p>Yes it is a team game</p>	


<h2><strong>RULES OF  THE GAME</strong></h2>
 
<p>Cricket is an Australian national pastime. It’s played all over the country, watched and loved by millions, and our national cricket team are looked up to as heroes by kids of all ages. Cricket is also a fun, social game to play, that’s easy to learn and can be enjoyed by boys and girls from as young as 5 years old. You will also find that most schools will include cricket as part of their physical education curriculum and nearly every town and suburb will have a team that plays in a local competition.  </p>

<h3>Basic Rules Of Cricket</h3>

        	Cricket is played between two teams each made up of eleven players. (Sometime in junior competitions you will find 8 player teams).<br>
•	Games comprise of at least one innings where each team will take turns in batting and fielding/bowling..<br>
•	The fielding team will have a bowler bowl the ball to the batsman who tries to hit the ball with their bat..<br>
•	The fielding team tries to get the batsmen out by…
o	Hitting the wickets with the ball when bowling
o	Catching a batsman’s shot on the full
o	Hitting the batsman’s leg in front of the wicket (LBW)
o	Or hitting the wickets before the batsmen can run to the other end of the pitch.<br>
•	The batmen try to score as many runs as possible before getting out by…
o	Hitting the ball and running between the wickets and making it to the other end before the fielders can hit the wickets with the ball. Each time you run one full length of the pitch it equals 1 run..
o	Hitting the ball to the boundary along the ground is 4 runs.
o	Hitting the ball over the boundary on the full equals 6 runs.
•	The fielding team must get 10 batsmen out before they can change over and start batting.
•	The aim of the game is to score as many runs as possible before the fielding team takes 10 wickets. The team with the most runs wins..<br>

<h2><strong>Circket game was invented</strong></h2>
•	The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century. Having originated in south-east England, it became an established sport in the country in the 18th century and developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries.



<h2><strong>Top 10 Most Unbeatable Cricket Records</strong></h2>

<h3>10. Jack Hobbs Runs and Centuries in 1st Class</h3>
<center><img src="img/2.jpeg" alt=""></center>
<p>At 10 of Unbeatable Cricket Records, just mind-boggling batting figures for Jack Hobbs in First-Class cricket. Jack Hobbs scored 61,237 runs in his First-Class career, Including 197 Centuries.
Jack Hobbs played First-Class cricket till he was past 50. His career figures now seem like no one can surpass them. His runs and centuries in First-Class cricket are the 10 most unbeatable cricket records in my mind.s</p>

<h3>9. Don Bradman 974 Runs in a Test Series</h3>
<center><img src="img/3.jpeg" alt=""></center>
<p>The next on unbeatable cricket records, Wally Hammond must have been chuffed when he totaled 905 runs on the Australian tour of 1928-29. In the next Ashes Series played in England, one of the greatest batsmen, Don Bradman, broke that record and made 974 runs in the five-match series.
His scores read 8 & 131 at Trent Bridge, 254 & 1 at Lord’s, 334 at Headingley, 14 in Manchester, and finally 232 at the Oval. The closest anyone has come to breaking Bradman’s record is when Vivian Richards Scored 829 runs out of the same opponent in 1976.</p>
<h3>8. Phil Simmons’ Economy Rate in an ODI</h3>
<center><img src="img/4.jpeg" alt=""></center>
<p>If you bowl out ten overs in a one-day international, the yardstick for a good performance is to finish with an economy rate of fewer than four runs per over (that’s under 40 runs conceded).
Look at Phil Simmons, he gave away just three runs for an economy rate of 0.3 runs per over in a one-day international match against Pakistan in 1992. Now, these days ODIs have become much more attack-minded so it’s hard to see Simmons’s mark being surpassed.</p>
<h3>7. Graham Gooch’s 456 Runs in a Test Match</h3>
<center><img src="img/5.jpeg" alt=""></center>
<p>Former English Captain Smashed 333 Runs in 1st innings against India at the Lords. In the 2nd inning, he also smashed quick 123 runs in 113 balls. He scored 456 runs in this match, as no one achieved that milestone, and looks like an unbeatable record.
Although one of the best left-handed batsmen, Brian Lara, later scored 400* runs against England, someone still needs to beat the Gooch’s record.</p>
<h3>6. Chaminda Vaas’ Bowling Figures in ODIs</h3>
<center><img src="img/6.jpeg" alt=""></center>
<p>Srilankan left-arm pacer Chaminda Vaas Bagged up 8 Zimbabwean Wicket for Just 19 Runs. And, became the only bowler in the history of the game to take 8 wickets in a one-day international match. Someone in the future could take more than eight wickets, but to do so would be miraculous given the batsman-centric nature of ODIs.
Moreover, this spell undoubtedly deserves its place in the best bowling figures in ODI’s cricket history. And with this spell, he secured his place among the greatest fast bowlers of all time.</p>
<h3>5. Australia’s Consecutive Test Wins</h3>
<center><img src="img/7.jpeg" alt=""></center>
<p>Australia managed 16 consecutive Test match wins twice, first between 1999-2001 under Steve Waugh and second between 2005-2008 under Ricky Ponting.
They have done it in their “Golden Years”, when they have the Bowling Attack likes of McGrath, Shen Warne, and Jason Gillespie, and have a batting line that Includes Steve Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Matthew Hayden, and Adam Gilchrist.</p>
<h3>4. Jim Laker’s Test Match Bowling Figures</h3>
<center><img src="img/8.jpeg" alt=""></center>
<p>English off-spinner Jim Laker missed only one of 20 wickets when he took 19 wickets for 90 runs against Australia at Old Trafford in 1956. He took 10 wickets in the first innings and 9 wickets in the 2nd. Ten wickets in a Test inning have been repeated by Anil Kumble, did it 1999 against Pakistan, but 19 in a match?
We’ll almost certainly never see it again. Besides, this spell also earned its place among the best bowling figures in test cricket.</p>
<h3>3. Muttiah Muralitharan’s International Wickets</h3>
<center><img src="img/9.jpeg" alt=""></center>
<p>
One of the greatest spin bowlers of all time, Murali, was only 20 when he first bowled for Sri Lanka. Soon proved effective as he baffled batsmen around the world.
Nearly 20 years later, he has taken 800 Test wickets, 534 one-day international wickets, and 13 Twenty20 International wickets. His 1347 international wickets for sure is an unbeatable record.</p>
<h3>2. Tendulkar’s International Matches, Runs, and Centuries</h3>
<center><img src="img/10.jpeg" alt=""></center>
<p>Sachin Tendulkar has amassed a mountain of batting records. He has 15,837 test runs with 51 centuries in 198 matches, and 18,426 ODI runs with 49 centuries in 463 matches.
Besides, he scored 34,273 runs in his international career, and each of these numbers is unlikely to be topped. Besides, he also topped the list of the greatest cricketers of all time.</p>
<h3>1. Don Bradman’s Test Career Batting Average</h3>
<center><img src="img/11.jpeg" alt=""></center>
<p>In 80 Test cricket innings, one of the greatest Australian athletes Don Bradman aka ‘The Don’ scored his runs at an average of 99.94. The next guy on the Test batting averages list managed a tick over 60. We can do all sorts of mathematical comparisons with these numbers but they would all show one thing: Bradman is one of the best batsmen the game has seen.
That Test average of 99.94 is a number you need to know, a kind of shorthand for Bradman’s exceptional talent. Just for good measure, his overall first-class average of 95.14 is unlikely to be beaten either.</p>

<h2><strong>STATISTICS</strong></h2>

<p>Cricket is a sport that generates a variety of statistics.
Statistics are recorded for each player during a match, and aggregated over a career. At the professional level, statistics for Test cricket, one-day internationals, and first-class cricket are recorded separately. However, since Test matches are a form of first-class cricket, a player's first-class statistics will include their Test match statistics – but not vice versa. Nowadays records are also maintained for List A and Twenty20 limited over matches. These matches are normally limited over games played domestically at the national level by leading Test nations. Since one-day internationals are a form of List A limited over matches, a player's List A statistics will include their ODI match statistics – but not vice versa.</p>
